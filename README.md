# Nestjs

Roadmap for becoming an expert NestJS engineer, with step-by-step guidance based on the topics found in the official [NestJS documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/).

---

## **1. Fundamentals (Beginner)**

**Goal**: Build a solid foundation in NestJS, understanding core principles, file structure, and essential components.

- **Introduction to NestJS**

  - Learn about the NestJS framework, its philosophy, and how it extends Node.js and Express to provide an application architecture similar to Angular.
  - Understand why TypeScript is central to NestJS and how NestJS leverages decorators, modules, and dependency injection for scalable and testable applications.

- **Creating a Basic Application**

  - Follow the NestJS CLI to create a new project: `nest new project-name`.
  - Explore the basic project structure (like `src` folder) to see how modules, controllers, and providers are organized.
  - Understand how `AppModule` acts as the root module and how it bootstraps the application.

- **Controllers**

  - Controllers handle incoming requests and return responses to the client.
  - Learn to create controllers with decorators like `@Controller()`, `@Get()`, and `@Post()`.
  - Understand routing, handling request parameters, query parameters, and different HTTP methods.

- **Providers**

  - Providers are classes annotated with `@Injectable()` and are used for creating and sharing services.
  - Understand dependency injection (DI) and how services encapsulate business logic for use in controllers.
  - Learn to inject services into controllers and other providers.

- **Modules**
  - NestJS applications are organized into modules to help with scalability and maintainability.
  - The `@Module()` decorator organizes related components (controllers and providers).
  - Learn to create feature modules and import/export them to make services available across the application.

## **2. Intermediate Concepts**

**Goal**: Gain knowledge of core features to build scalable and maintainable applications.

- **Middleware**

  - Middleware functions are executed before route handlers. They’re commonly used for logging, authentication, or request modification.
  - Learn to apply middleware globally, at the module level, or to specific routes.
  - Use NestJS’s `@Injectable()` decorator for dependency-injected middleware.

- **Exception Handling**

  - NestJS provides a built-in mechanism for handling exceptions with `@Catch()` and custom exceptions.
  - Learn to create global, local, and custom exception filters to handle errors like `NotFoundException` and `BadRequestException`.
  - Implement custom exception filters and error responses based on the application's needs.

- **Pipes**

  - Pipes in NestJS can be used to transform and validate incoming data.
  - Master using built-in pipes like `ValidationPipe` for input validation with class validators.
  - Create custom pipes to apply transformation and validation logic specific to application requirements.

- **Guards and Interceptors**

  - Guards are used for authorization; they determine if a request can proceed to the route handler.
  - Interceptors can modify incoming requests or outgoing responses, ideal for logging, response transformation, or error handling.
  - Implement built-in guards (like `AuthGuard`) and custom guards for complex authorization.

- **Testing**

  - Understand the basics of unit testing with `@nestjs/testing` and Jest.
  - Learn to write tests for individual units (services, controllers) and end-to-end (e2e) tests for API flows.
  - Use dependency injection for mocking and creating isolated tests for components.

- **Dependency Injection (DI)**
  - Master the DI container in NestJS, where services are managed automatically.
  - Learn about injection scopes (singleton, request-scoped) and when to use them.

---

## **3. Advanced Topics**

**Goal**: Build expertise in advanced NestJS features to enable complex, real-time, and scalable applications.

- **Databases and ORM**

  - Connect to databases (like MongoDB, PostgreSQL) using TypeORM, Prisma, or Mongoose.
  - Master CRUD operations, database migrations, and schema validation with ORMs.
  - Implement repository patterns for cleaner, scalable, and testable codebases.

- **GraphQL**

  - Build GraphQL APIs using NestJS’s built-in support for GraphQL.
  - Understand how to define GraphQL schemas and resolvers.
  - Use `@Resolver()`, `@Query()`, and `@Mutation()` decorators, and explore techniques to optimize GraphQL queries.

- **WebSockets**

  - Add WebSocket support to enable real-time communication.
  - Implement WebSocket gateways and handle events using decorators like `@SubscribeMessage()`.
  - Build real-time features such as live notifications, chat systems, or data streaming.

- **Microservices Architecture**

  - Explore NestJS’s microservices capabilities to build distributed applications.
  - Learn about message patterns (e.g., `@MessagePattern()`) and transporters (like Redis, MQTT, or gRPC).
  - Scale the application by dividing features across multiple microservices for independent scaling.

- **CQRS and Event Sourcing**

  - Implement CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) to separate reading and writing operations.
  - Explore the CQRS module in NestJS to manage commands and events separately.
  - Use event sourcing to maintain a complete history of actions, ideal for audit-tracking and complex systems.

- **Caching**
  - Use caching to optimize performance and reduce load on your database.
  - Integrate Redis or other caching providers and manage caching strategies (e.g., setting expiration times, cache invalidation).
  - Implement cache decorators or inject caching services directly.

## **4. Expert-Level Skills**

**Goal**: Master the complete NestJS ecosystem, deploying, securing, and optimizing applications.

- **Advanced Performance Optimization**

  - Implement NestJS-specific performance optimizations like enabling Fastify as a transport layer or applying lazy loading for modules.
  - Use profiling tools to analyze and address performance bottlenecks.

- **Custom Decorators**

  - Create custom decorators to encapsulate repetitive logic, improving readability and reducing code duplication.
  - Learn to create custom class and parameter decorators using `@ReflectMetadata()`.

- **Security**

  - Implement security best practices like JWT authentication, OAuth2, and role-based access control (RBAC).
  - Apply security headers (e.g., `helmet`) and ensure data encryption for sensitive data.
  - Conduct vulnerability checks using NestJS’s compatibility with external libraries for app security.

- **API Documentation**

  - Use `@nestjs/swagger` to automatically generate API documentation for RESTful APIs.
  - Annotate controllers and services for clear, developer-friendly documentation that integrates with Swagger UI.

- **Configuration and Environments**

  - Learn to manage configuration in different environments (development, testing, production) using the `@nestjs/config` module.
  - Organize sensitive data (like API keys, secrets) using environment variables and `.env` files.

- **Deployment and DevOps**
  - Learn to deploy NestJS applications on cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean.
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
  - Integrate Docker for containerization, improving scalability and reducing configuration issues across different environments.
